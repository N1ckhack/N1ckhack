# About Me

Hello everyone, I'm from Russia. It's cold here sometimes, but it's very cool. I am an information security student and my specialty is closely related to cybersecurity, digital forensics and secure development. Therefore, I decided to start GitHub in order to organize and share my projects to help my colleagues in the field.
>In addition to the above, I am a member of the university's CTF competition team. Accordingly, the specifics of these competitions can often be related to my projects.

I hope that the code that you will find in my profile will make your studies easier and you will understand certain aspects of information security much better. This will help you on the path to the truth and will also boost your brain and skills.
